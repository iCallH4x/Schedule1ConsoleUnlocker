### Schedule1ConsoleUnlocker
This is a very scrappy MelonLoader mod that enables the dev console (F8) and registers all of the commands built into the game (and adds one - unhideui). Until I release a full list of commands and usage, please see the code and figure out what the commands are/do.


# This may not work moving into full release. If we do not get a proper console implementation, I'll consider keeping this updated.
